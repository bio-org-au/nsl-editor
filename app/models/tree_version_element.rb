#  A tree version element - a link table between tree version and tree element
#  The tree version element tells you which tree elements are in this version
#  of a tree. It has a specific identifier called element_link and a taxon
#  identifier called taxon_link

#  A Tree Version Element is a link between the tree version and the tree element.
