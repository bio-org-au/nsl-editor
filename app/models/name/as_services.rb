  # Service will send back 200 even if delete fails, but will also sometimes

  # The interface *should* never let a user try to delete a name that cannot be
  # deleted, so the chances of hitting a 'meaningful' error are [supposed to
  # be] small.
  # The service error messages are not suitable for showing to users. e.g.
  # "There are 1 that cite this.", raw database messages like multi-level
  # foreign key technical errors, but we get them often enough that we
  # need to pass them through to the application GUI.
