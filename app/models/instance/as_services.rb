  # Service will send back 200 even if delete fails, but will also sometimes
  # send back 404, so have to look at both. Sigh.
  #
  # (PMc Note) Actually...A 404 is sent if the target is not found, but
  # when the target of the delete *is* found but you can't delete it because
  # it is referenced, you get a 403 Forbidden. Looking at it again we should 
  # possibly return 409 conflict... don't you love interpreting standards (RFC 7231)
  #
  # The interface *should* never let a user try to delete an instance
  # that cannot be deleted, so the chances of hitting a 'meaningful' error
  # should be small but experience has shown this happens.
  # The service error messages are not always good for showing to users, but
  # users need to see them, so we attribute them.
  #
  # RestClient throws exceptions for 403, 404 type errors and we handle those
  # based on the structured response to extract a meaningful message.
